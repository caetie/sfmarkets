Took market list from Together in Food and entered into a Google Doc.\
Fill in gaps and added to dataset by googling each market and confirming or refining address to prepare data for geocoding.\
Added data about market start and end times and dates.\
Added neighborhood column.\
Filled in website information for every market for which it was available. In the absence of a website, included phone number. But if there was a website, didn't note phone number.\
\
TD: check comments from Together in Food page to see about any updates to data set.\
\
TD: email Together in Food team to let them know about the site, that I used their list as the basis.\
